          A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.
          <br />
          <br />
          The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
          companies has allowed me to develop a skillst that helps me in not
          just development, but in every aspect of any business.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Proud to announce that I am working at one of the world's largest
          communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a
          developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
          holding you back is yourself.
          <br />
          <br />
          A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what i mean.
          <br />
          <br />
          <q>How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail ?</q>
          You've already gone through the hardest parts of being a developer,
          it's time to elevate ypur skills and become a leader in something
          you're passionate about.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
          company.
